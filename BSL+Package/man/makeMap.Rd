\title{create map and QTL effects}
\usage{
makeMap(map, nLoci, nMarkers, nQTL, propDomi, interactionMean, qtlInfo = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{map}{map information (Chromosome and Position)}

\item{nLoci}{the number of markers and QTL}

\item{nMarkers}{the number of markers, which is used especially for genomic selection}

\item{nQTL}{the number of QTLs controlling the target trait}

\item{propDomi}{the probability of dominant QTL among the all QTL}

\item{interactionMean}{the expected number of epistatic loci for each effect}

\item{qtlInfo}{possible to give the function all of the qtl information}
}
\value{
map data including which loci are primary QTL and which are modifying loci, which have dominance effects, the effect sizes
}
